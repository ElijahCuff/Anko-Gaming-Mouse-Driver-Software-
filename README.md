# Anko-Gaming-Mouse-Driver-Software-
The anko gaming mouse from Kmart has terrible instructions for setting up the software, it includes an incorrect URL in the manual and makes it cumbersome task searching for the correct drivers - for this reason I have backed up the drivers for several models - please check the underside for model reference to the correct driver versions.
